I will need to investigate this.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies  \r\n  \r\n**NEW: deps/ folder to make installation of dependecies as easy as possible! Files for the major platforms.**\r\n  \r\n- perl  \r\n- [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)  \r\n- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) **(Python)**  \r\n  \r\nIf you have cpan, run `sudo deps/deps.sh` from the repository. This will install all required dependencies.   Otherwise, you will have to download and install them manually from [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org).\r\n\r\n## Usage  \r\n   \r\n`./fbsounds [ -o <output-dir>  -f <audio-format>  -q <audio-quality> -n <max-downloads> -n max_videos -r -sp -ytdl \"args\" ] <facebook-id>`  \r\n  \r\nWhere `-sp` stands for \"skip YouTube playlists\".  \r\nWhen `-r` is given a retry on error will be performed.  \r\nWith `-ytdl \"args\"` you can add custom arguments to youtube-dl. Wrap them in parentheses.  \r\nLimit the number of processed videos with the `-n` flag.  \r\nSee `youtube-dl -h` for available formats, qualities and other options.  \r\nDefault format:  **best**  \r\nDefault quality: **320K**  \r\n\r\nTo halt the script while downloading, hit **CTRL-Z** for a SIGKILL.  \r\nWait.. could I possibly add a signal handler to the youtube-dl system call? **TODO**\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT:** For audio conversion to work, you must have the corresponding audio codec library installed, for example lame for mp3 and libvorbis for ogg.  \r\n  \r\n## Contribution  \r\n  \r\nTo get your local copy with **all the submodules**:  \r\n`git clone --recursive https://github.com/rub1k/fbsounds.git`  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
